C++ was developed in 1985 by **Bjarne Stroustrup**. It has many standarts as language is developing significantly. Current one is C++23 (1340 pages).

C++ is:
1. complex,
2. multi-paradigmatic,
3. efficient,
4. low-level language,
5. compiling,
6. statistically typed (статически типизированный).

С++ inherited C syntax, but C++ is not C's superset (надмножество).

Developing tools:
1. Compilers: **clang**, gcc.
2. Auto-assembling systems: **cmake**, qmake.
3. IDE: Clion (banned on course :), **VS code**.
4. Testing: google.test, boost.test.
5. Version control systems: Git.

P.s. We are in a coding sandbox, so NO GPT, agents, etc.
